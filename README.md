# Machine_Learning_Project
This project involved developing machine learning models to predict the risk category (low, medium, high) of restaurants based on inspection data from San Francisco. The raw dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature selection. Various ML algorithms were trained including linear models, geometric models, probabilistic models, tree-based models, ensembles, and rule-based models. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and RMSE. Techniques like k-fold cross-validation were used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The voting classifier ensemble achieved the best performance with ~86% accuracy. The models can help identify high-risk restaurants requiring more frequent inspections. The project provided hands-on experience in data cleaning, feature engineering, model implementation, evaluation, and selection for a real-world prediction task.
